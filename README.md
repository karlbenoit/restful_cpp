# restful_cpp #
This project aims to expose facilities to ease development of restful webservices that can leverage the power of C++. Those facilities are based on [Wt](https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt).

This project is experimental and in a very early stage and therefore not suitable for any kind of integration.
